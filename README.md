**Lektos** (from the Greek word *λεκτός*) means **"chosen," "selected," or "gathered."**  
Although it resembles the Greek verb *légo* (λέγω, "to say"), *lektos* comes from a different root — one that emphasizes collection and curation.

This reflects the core mission of **Lektos**:

> To gather, structure, and surface meaningful blog content from across the web.

With **Lektos**, we don’t just crawl — we **curate**.  
Every piece of content is carefully extracted, filtered, and organized
